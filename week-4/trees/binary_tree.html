  <h1>Binary Tree</h1>
  <p>A binary tree is a type of tree data structure where each parent node can have at most two children.</p>
  <p>There are different types of binary trees</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full binary tree: a binary tree where each parent has zero or two children</li>
    <li>Perfect binary tree: a type of binary tree where each internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.</li>
    <li>Balanced binary tree: a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree on any node do not differ by more than one.</li>
    <li>Binary search tree: a binary tree that allows for efficient searching</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Binary Search Tree</h1>
  <p>A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each node has a key that is greater than or equal to the keys in all nodes in the left subtree and less than or equal to the keys in all nodes in the right subtree.</p>
  <!--talk about the implementation of bst-->
  <h2>Binary Search Tree - Insertion</h2>
  <p>Insertion in a binary search tree is done by recursively traversing the tree until the correct position is found for the new node.</p>
  <p>The correct position for a node is found by comparing the key of the node with the key of the node to be inserted. If the key of the node to be inserted is less than the key of the node, the node is inserted in the left subtree of the node. If the key of the node to be inserted is greater than the key of the node, the node is inserted in the right subtree of the node.</p>
  <h1>Binary Search Tree - Traversal</h1>
  <p>In order traversal of a binary search tree is done by recursively traversing the left subtree, the node and then the right subtree.</p>
  <h2>Binary Search Tree - Search</h2>
  <p>Search in a binary search tree is done by recursively traversing the tree until the correct node is found.</p>
  <h2>Binary Search Tree - Deletion</h2>
  <p>Deletion in a binary search tree is done by recursively traversing the tree until the correct node is found for deletion. The node to be deleted is then replaced by the node with the smallest key in the right subtree of the node to be deleted. The node with the smallest key in the right subtree is then deleted.</p>
