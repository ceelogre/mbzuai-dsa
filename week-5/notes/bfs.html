  <h1>Breadth First Search Algorithm</h1>
  <p> BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbors of a node and then moves to the next level of the graph. It is often used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. </p>
  <p> The algorithm is similar to Depth First Search, but it uses a queue instead of a stack. </p>
  <p>Example:</p>

  <p>Here's an implementation of the BFS algorithm in JavaScript:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
    function bfs(graph, start) {
      const visited = {};
      const queue = [start];
      while (queue.length) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        if (!visited[node]) {
          visited[node] = true;
          queue.push(...graph[node]);
        }
      }
      return visited;
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>As you can see, the BFS algorithm is similar to the Depth First Search algorithm, but it uses a queue instead of a stack. </p>
