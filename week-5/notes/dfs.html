  <h1>Depth First Search Algorithm</h1>
  <p>Often abbreviated as DFS, the depth-first search algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all paths between any two given vertices. The algorithm is also known as a graph-search algorithm because it is used to search for a path in a graph.</p>
  <p>The algorithm is recursive and has the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mark the current node as visited.</li>
    <li>Explore all the neighbors of the current node.</li>
    <li>If the current node has no unvisited neighbors, backtrack to the previous node.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <img src="dfs.png" alt="DFS Algorithm">
  <p>Here's an implementation of the DFS algorithm in JavaScript:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
    function dfs(graph, start) {
      const visited = {};
      const stack = [start];
      while (stack.length) {
        const node = stack.pop();
        if (!visited[node]) {
          visited[node] = true;
          stack.push(...graph[node]);
        }
      }
      return visited;
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>After finding all connected graph nodes, it becomes easy to perform other operations like find a path between two nodes and finding the shortest path among others.</p>
  <p>Example: See VS code</p>
