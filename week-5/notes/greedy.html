  <h1>Greedy Algorithms</h1>
  <p>Greedy algorithms are algorithms that make decisions based on the current state of the problem. They try to come up with a solution at a given stage and never reverses in case the decision made was not the most optimal.</p>
  <p>Some examples of greedy algorithms are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dijkstra's algorithm</li>
    <li>Prim's algorithm</li>
    <li>Kruskal's algorithm</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Greedy algorithms are often used in the following problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduling problems</li>
    <li>Finding the best way to maximize the profit</li>
    <li>Finding the best way to minimize the cost</li>
    <li>Finding the best way to minimize the time</li>
    <li>Finding the best way to minimize the distance</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Disadvantage</h3>
  <p>Greedy algorithms solutions are not always the most optimal. This is because the algorithm is focused on just  finding a solution and not on finding the optimal solution. </p>
  <h4>Example: Find the longest path using greedy algorithm</h4>

  <h4>Steps of a greedy algorithm</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the node with the highest value</li>
    <li>Add it to the solution</li>
    <li>Remove it from the graph</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here's another example of a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount of money:</p>
  <p>Here's an implementation of the greedy algorithm in JavaScript:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
    function greedy(coins, amount) {
      const sortedCoins = coins.sort((a, b) => b - a);
      let count = 0;
      for (let coin of sortedCoins) {
        while (amount >= coin) {
          amount -= coin;
          count++;
        }
      }
      return count;
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>The algorithm visits each coin in the array and subtracts it from the amount until the amount is less than the coin. It then increments the count of the coin. </p>
