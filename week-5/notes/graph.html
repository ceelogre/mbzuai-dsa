  <h1>Graph Data Structure</h1>
  <p>A graph is a type of data structure in which a group of nodes are interconnected via edges.</p>
  <h2>Graph Terminologies</h2>
  <p>A directed graph is a graph in which edges are labeled with a direction. A directed edge from node A to node B is denoted as A->B.</p>
  <p>An undirected graph is a graph in which edges are not labeled with a direction. An undirected edge from node A to node B is denoted as A-B.</p>
  <p>Adjacency: The relationship between two nodes is called adjacency. Two nodes are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.</p>
  <p>Path: A path is a sequence of nodes that are connected by edges.</p>
  <p>Cycle: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.</p>
  <p>Degree: The number of edges connected to a node.</p>
  <h2>Graph representation</h2>
  <p>A graph is represented by a set of nodes and a set of edges. Each node is represented by a unique integer.</p>
  <p>Each edge is represented by a pair of nodes. The nodes are connected by an edge.</p>
  <p>Graphs can be represented in mostly two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adjacency List</li>
    <li>Adjacency Matrix</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Adjacency List</h2>
  <p>Adjacency list is a list of nodes and a list of edges. Each node is represented by a unique integer.</p>

  <h2>Adjacency Matrix</h2>
  <p>Adjacency matrix is a matrix of nodes and a matrix of edges. Each node is represented by a unique integer.</p>
